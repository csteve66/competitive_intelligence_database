# Competitive Intelligence Database

An agentic AI system built with LangGraph that autonomously researches Honeywell's competitors in the pressure transmitter market. The LLM decides which tools to call, what to search, and when to stop. Results are stored in Neo4j (structured graph) and ChromaDB (evidence chunks for human in the loop verification).

## Architecture

The system uses a LangGraph StateGraph with two nodes (`agent` and `tools`) in a loop:

1. `agent` node calls the LLM with bound tools. LLM decides which tools to call.
2. `should_continue` checks if LLM returned tool calls. If yes → go to tools, if no → end.
3. `tools` node executes the tool calls, results go back to agent, repeat until done.

**Tools (LLM chooses which to call):**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_web` | Tavily web search |
| `extract_page_content` | Tavily page extraction + stores chunks in ChromaDB |
| `save_competitor` | Saves company with evidence link |
| `save_product` | Saves product + specs with evidence link |
| `research_customer_segments` | Finds customer groups in industry (LLM generates queries, stores evidence) |
| `map_segments_to_products` | Maps which products serve which customer segments |
| `research_industry_needs` | Searches 8+ sources, generates comprehensive needs report |
| `map_needs_from_report` | Extracts needs from report and maps to products |
| `generate_house_of_quality` | Creates QFD matrix mapping customer needs to specs |
| `get_current_progress` | Returns current research status |
| `finish_research` | Signals completion |

**Data Storage:**

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **ChromaDB** | Raw text chunks from web pages (evidence for verification) |
| **Neo4j** | Structured knowledge graph (Companies, Products, Specifications, CustomerNeeds, CustomerSegments) |

## How It Works

**Agent Loop:**
1. LLM receives the conversation history and decides which tools to call
2. If LLM returns tool calls → execute them, add results to conversation, go back to step 1
3. If LLM returns no tool calls (or calls `finish_research`) → end
4. Final data written to Neo4j

**Research Strategy (Four Phases):**
- **Phase 1**: Find competitors and their products with specs
- **Phase 2**: Research customer segments (who buys pressure transmitters) and map products to segments
- **Phase 3**: Generate comprehensive industry needs report (from 8+ sources), then map needs to product specs
- **Phase 4**: Build House of Quality (QFD) matrix mapping customer needs to specifications

**Graph Structure:**
```
Honeywell ─COMPETES_WITH→ Competitor ─OFFERS_PRODUCT→ Product ─HAS_SPEC→ Specification
                                                          │
                                                          ├─ADDRESSES_NEED→ CustomerNeed
                                                          │
                                                          └─ADDRESSES_CUSTOMER_SEGMENT→ CustomerSegment
```


## Setup

### 1. Create Environment

```bash
# Using conda (recommended)
conda create -n ci_db python=3.11 -y
conda activate ci_db

# OR using venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```
### 4. Install Neo4j

Download and install Neo4j desktop from the following website:  
[neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/)

Then open Neo4j and create a local instance with the same username/password as in the .env file.

### 5. Start Neo4j

## Usage

### Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py --iterations 20 --industry "oil and gas"
```

### Launch Dashboard

```bash
python main.py --streamlit

# Or directly:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Verify Evidence

Evidence verification is done through the Streamlit dashboard's **"✅ Verify Data"** tab, which:
- Shows all relationships from Neo4j
- Retrieves original source evidence from ChromaDB
- Displays the exact text and source URL for human verification
